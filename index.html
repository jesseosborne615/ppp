    <p1>You know baby I wish that life was a little easier sometimes<br>
        And that we used our brains a little bit more than our hearts<br>
        But I'm pretty smitten by you<br>
        So I think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life following you around like a little puppy dog<br>
        Worshipping the ground that you walk on<br>
        And wanting to kiss your pretty little face every time that I see it<br>
        Cause I done plum fell in love<br><br>
        I wish that it was easy<br>
        That I could walk away<br>That I wasn't always dreaming of your face<br>
        and thinking all the happy things that are possible to think<br>
        We're partners in crime 'til the end of time<br>
        Sweet Pea it's you and me<br><br>
        Because I done plum fell in love<br><br>
        I wish that it was midnight<br>And you were fast asleep<br>
        And I stayed up all night long<br>Starin' at your feet<br>
        As they go up and down and north and south<br>
        Softly on our bed<br>Getting comfy while you make sweet dreams<br>
        inside your peanut head<br><br>I think I done plum fell in love<br>With you
    </p1>
